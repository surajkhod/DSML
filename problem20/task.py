# Write a program to cluster a set of points using K-means for IRIS
# dataset. Consider, K=3, clusters. Consider Euclidean distance as the
# distance measure. Randomly initialize a cluster mean as one of the data
# points. Iterate at least for 10 iterations. After iterations are over, print the
# final cluster means for each of the clusters.
