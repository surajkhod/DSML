The decision for the test data `[Age > 35, Income = Medium, Gender = Female, Marital Status = Married]` depends on the trained decision tree model derived from the dataset. Based on the code provided:

1. The test data is encoded as `[2, 1, 1, 1]`:
   - `Age > 35` → `2`
   - `Income = Medium` → `1`
   - `Gender = Female` → `1`
   - `Marital Status = Married` → `1`

2. After running the code:
   - If the path in the decision tree leads to a "Yes" leaf, the output is **"Buys Yes"**.
   - If the path leads to a "No" leaf, the output is **"Buys No"**.

### Typical Scenario (Assumption):
In many datasets with these patterns:
- If age is greater than 35 and income is medium, and the customer is female and married, it often indicates a higher likelihood of purchasing the product (`Buys = Yes`).
- However, the exact decision depends on the dataset used for training.

To confirm:
Run the provided code on the dataset and observe the result from:
```python
prediction = model.predict(test_data)
```

For this test case, the decision is likely to be:
**"The decision for the test data is: Buys Yes"**, assuming these conditions align with the trends in the dataset.
